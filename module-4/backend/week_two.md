Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week. 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is Webpack and why is it useful?
 Â - Webpack is a build tool that helps make a developer's life easier by bundling dependencies, compressing JS into one file, and making it easier to work with the browser.

4. How are you using the MVC design pattern in your Quantified Self project?

7. What is CORS?
  - Cross-origin resource sharing
  
8. What are some steps to avoid CORS?

  - Flexible, continuous and rapid improvement
  
12. What are some advantages/disadvantages to using OAuth to authenticate a user?
